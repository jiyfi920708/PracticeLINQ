Preliminary Activities

1) Create a class called Student

2) Override the ToString method so that we can specify what it looks like when you print a Student to the console

3) Do all the setup required to use Entity Framework Core to connect to a SQLite database

4) Seed the database with the names and information for all students in the class today

Where Practice

1) Connect to the database and show all records in the Students table

2) Connect to the database and show all records of students who are not seniors

3) Connect to the database and show all students whose first names begin with letters 'M' or lower

4) Connect to the database and show all students whose last names begin with letters "L" or higher and whose first names are longer than 6 characters

5) Connect to the database and show all students who have taken CIDM3350 previously (hint: maybe you need to refactor?)

Find Practice

1) Connect to the database and find a student named "John" and print that record to the screen

2) Connect to the database and find a student named "Alexander" and print that record to the screen

3) Connect to the database and find a student who has the shortest first name and print that record to the screen

4) Connect to the database and find a student who has the shortest last name and print that record to the screen

5)  Connect to the database and find a student who has the shortest last name but also has the longest first name and print that record to the screen

Sort Practice

1) Connect to the database and show all students sorted by first name

2) Connect to the database and show all students sorted by last name descending

3) Connect to the database and show all students sorted by rank (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Graduate Student)

4)  Connect to the database and show students who are Seniors and sorted by last name

5) Connect to the database and show students who are NOT Seniors and sorted by first name descending

Group Practice

1) Connect to the database and show all students Grouped by class rank

2) Connect to the database and show all students Grouped by class rank and sorted by last name

3) Connect to the database and show all students Grouped by the first letter of their last name and sorted by first name
